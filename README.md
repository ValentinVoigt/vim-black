# Vim Black

This plugin is a direct copy of the [official plugin](https://github.com/ambv/black/tree/master/plugin). I've made this dedicated repo so it is easy to use a git submodule to install the plugin, which is how I prefer to manage all my vim plugins. It's totally possible that there is a smarter way to include a single file from the Black repo, but for now this gives my dev env a consistent setup.
